# Wireframe Design

This part of the documentation contains all wireframe designs used for the development of the group project.

Each wireframe design includes a small description of what the application is meant to look like and why this has been chosen.

Wireframes are designed on Balsamiq Wireframes which was recommended to Professor Mark Perry in the CS2003 Usability Engineering module.

## Login Page

The login page has been designed with a simple layout including the username/password form and links for registering and resetting users. We have included the Single Sign-on images from Google and Twitter which we will implement. The desktop version has a different layout to the mobile version - we have chosen to do this as part of responsive design to differentiate the versions and make it more accessible between devices of different size.
