# MySQL Certificates

This folder contains certificates used by our test server

## Client JKS files

The JKS keystore and truststore used for the client has the secret `Gr0UpS3v3NS3cr3t` used.

The keystore was generated by converting the generated certificate and key by MySQL Workbench to a PKCS12 format using openssl and then to JKS using Jetty. The truststore was generated by converting the certificate to a DER format using openssl and then to JKS using keytool. [1]
